Title: 
PVC Backup, Restore, and Workload Volume Cloning with KubeStash

Description: 
If you are using a volume that can be mounted in multiple workloads, you might want to backup the volume independently of the workloads. KubeStash supports backup and restore of stand-alone volumes. Moreover, you have the flexibility to provide a template for PVCs within the restoresession, enabling the seamless cloning of data volumes of a workload. KubeStash will create those PVCs according to the template, then it will restore data into those PVCs.

Here's a sneak preview of the webinar agenda:
- Streamlined PVC Backup Processes
- Effortless PVC Restore Procedure
- Trouble-free Workload Volumes Cloning Technique
- Live Walk-through and Demonstration
